Air. It's what we breathe every second of our life. We can live without water, food for a while, but air is something we just can't do without.

Okay, Air is important. Big deal!

It is a big deal as we breathe in 12000 Kilograms of air each day. That is 3000 gallons each day. Clearly prolonged exposure to certain toxics can cause everlasting damages. 

Okay, I understand , it is a big deal. So, how can I live in pure air?

Well pure air as traditionally thought of is 100% pure air, which is just not possible practically.
While we pump in C02 all the time from our vehicles and chimneys,  we can only dream of 100% pure air. On the other hand, air with permissible levels of pollution is okay with our health. Then again, there are specifics depending on who you are, what age group you belong to, and any specific ailments you may have.

You see, traditional systems have always simply considered numbers. Now we want something tangible. Something we can understand and make sense of. We just want to know if it's healthy to be in a place or not.

This is where Cool For Me comes into picture.

It works like magic. 

You see, we at Cool For Me, understand that not all places are for all people. Climate and air quality, like a shirt, is not a one size fits all thingy.

Just upload your photo and we will tell if you are living in a place that's cool for you.
