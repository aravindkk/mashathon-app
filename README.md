## Cool For Me

Cool For Me is a web application that helps you decide if a place is cool for you or not based on it's air quality. Air quality is not a one size fits all thing. Give us your photo and we will assess if a place is cool for you or not. 

Cool For Me is based on advanced machine learning capabilities derived from HP Idol OnDemand API and from the awesome air quality data from Breezometer API. This cutting edge technology lets us run predictions of how the air quality will change over time and report on the next 2 years with high accuracy.

Whether you are planning a vacation, or considering a new home, or just curious about your current home, Cool For Me is just the app for you.
